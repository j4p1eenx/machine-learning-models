Using sklearn.datasets iris flower dataset to train our model using logistic regression. 
We displayed the accuracy of our model visually by using seaborn heatmap and use that to predict different samples in our test dataset(in-built library)
In iris dataset there are 150 samples containing following features,
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width

Using above four features we classified a flower in one of the three categories
